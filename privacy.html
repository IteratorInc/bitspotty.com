      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information when you visit our site and use our products and
        services. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites (collectively, "Services")
        offered by Iterator, Inc. ("us", "we", "our", "BitSpotty" or "Iterator"), or its subsidiaries or affiliated
        companies.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>
        Our web servers automatically log your IP address and information about your device. This helps us find people
        who abuse the service. We retain this information for 30 days. Your device generates an anonymized token we can
        use in order to send you (or stop sending you) push notifications through Apple’s Push Notification Service.
        Please email help@iterator.ca to let us know what we could do better.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Log information:</strong> When you access our Services, our servers automatically record information
            that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your
            web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request
            and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information in aggregate to
            help understand what types of devices use the Service, and to help detect abuse of the Service. We retain
            this information for 30 days.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>User communications:</strong> When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those
            communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. We
            offer some of our services in connection with other websites. Personal information that you provide to those
            sites may be sent to Iterator in order to deliver the service. We process such information in accordance
            with this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to
            read their privacy policies.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Other sites:</strong> This Privacy Policy applies to Iterator and Iterator&rsquo;s other Services
            only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as links from our Services. These other sites may
            place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from
            you.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we Use collected Information</h2>

      <p>
        Iterator only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or any
        specific notices given for specific Services. Such purposes include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Providing Services to our users;</li>

        <li>Research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</li>

        <li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and</li>

        <li>Developing new services.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you provide us with personal information when you sign up to our Services and we use that information in a
        manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such
        use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iterator processes personal information on servers in Canada, the United States of America and in other
        countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process
        personal information to provide our own Services.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>

      <p>
        Our Services may allow you to opt-out of certain information gathering and sharing or to opt-out of certain
        Services or features. You will be explained how to do so at each occasion where you have such choices.
      </p>

      <h2>Information Sharing</h2>

      <p>
        We may share your information with third parties we use to perform certain functions, such as hosting. These
        parties will be contractually bound to treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and any
        other confidentiality and security measures instructed by us. Otherwise, we will only share your information if
        we have your consent, or, we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such
        information is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b)
        enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent,
        or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights,
        property or safety of Iterator, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Iterator becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will
        provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Accessing, updating, and deleting personal information</h2>

      <p>
        When you use Iterator&rsquo;s Services, we will make efforts to provide you with reasonable access to your
        personal information, so that such data can be either updated or deleted at your request if it is not otherwise
        required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask users to identify themselves and the
        information requested to be accessed processing such requests. We may decline to process unreasonable requests,
        requests which require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be
        extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. Please contact us at help@iterator.ca if
        you would like access to whatever information we are able to associate with you, or if you would like us to
        delete any information we are able to associate with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, unless if doing so
        would require a disproportionate effort.
      </p>
